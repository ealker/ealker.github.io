### Smarthome

I have an interest in smarthome technology. I've setup [a page](/projects/smarthome) to document my progress. 

### Writing 

My [blog](/blog) contains a collection of my notes, articles, musings, rants, etc. and is an ongoing project in itself. Why do I blog? [Steve Yegge](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs) has the answer.
