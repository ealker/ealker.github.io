title: "A New Monitor" 
---

#### Boring Context 

My employer recently subsidized a new monitor purchase for my work from home computer setup.
Initially I was unsure about what specs to look for in a new monitor. Now, I know most of the technical terms, I've seen friends' 240Hz IPS panels, 32" VA panels and all sorts of monitors in between, however up until this point I've used a variety of hand-me-down monitors from friends and relatives. The only new monitors I've purchased have been a Dell P2419H, which was also subsidised by my employer in 2020, and a 21" Samsung SyncMaster in ~2011. (I was also gifted a Dell UltraSharp U2719D which broke.)

#### Use Case 

After reading [Tonksy's post about 4K monitors](https://tonsky.me/blog/monitors/), and realising I had a similar use case to him, I decided to shop around for a panel with the following specs: 

```
Resolution: 4K
Display Technology: VA panel 
Price: <$400 (my employer gave me a dollar limit to spend rather than a list of approved hardware).
```

This monitor also had to work with my existing hardware, which is a Dell OptiPlex 3070 SFF which I purchased earlier last year for the sole use of connecting to my work's LDI.


Graphics specs on my work from home PC: 

```
- Intel 630 Graphics (9th Gen I5-9500) 
- 1 DisplayPort 1.2 connector 
- 1 HDMI 1.4 connector
```

HDMI can't do 4K at 60Hz, which was (is) rather annoying considering I want 4K output at 60Hz. I planned to use 200% scaling to achieve a 1080p useable display area with a much greater pixel density (closer to Retina display pixel density). This lead me to lookup DisplayPort's capabilities - it turns out that DisplayPort 1.2 _can_ output 4K at 60Hz so I added a DisplayPort to the list of "must have" features for my new monitor. 

In the end, one monitor stood out, the [Samsung UJ59 32" 4K monitor](https://www.samsung.com/uk/monitors/high-resolution/uj59-32-inch-uhd-4k-lu32j592uqrxxu/). Samsung markets this panel as a sort of TV replacement with gaming capabilities, but I don't really care about any of that.
