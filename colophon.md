This page is about this site. 
I think it's best to begin with my philosophy around this website before I dive into the technical aspects of it. 

Over the last few years my approach to technology has become more like [Jeff Kaufman's](https://www.jefftk.com/p/retrogrouch).

This is also a [good read](https://frankchimero.com/blog/2018/everything-easy/).

The philosophy behind this site's design is centered in a desire for a fast and minimal experience and a no-bs approach. The [death to bullshit](https://deathtobullshit.com/) website encapsulates this philosophy when it comes to content. 

This site works well on a modern Apple Silicon based Macintosh as it does a Tandy PC, iPhone SE or a microwave with built in WiFi and a colour screen.
