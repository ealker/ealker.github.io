title: Notes on Self Hosting
---

This past year I've started self hosting some services on a small home server. A lot of people have complex, expensive and rather overwhelming homelabs but my lone server setup falls on the cheaper and simpler end of the spectrum. 

Let's start with the hardware, a second hand HP EliteDesk G2 800 Mini. It has 8GB RAM, 120GB SSD and an external 1TB USB 3.0 hard disk.
