This is my [uses](https://uses.tech/) page. I drew inspiration from Wes Bos' [/uses project](https://wesbos.com/uses), Paul Stamatiou's [gear page](https://paulstamatiou.com/stuff-i-use/) and the [Uses This](https://usesthis.com) interviews.

## Hardware 

### Workstation

I use a 2016 15" MacBook Pro, 2013 11" MacBook Air and a Dell OptiPlex 3070.


### [Homelab](2022/10/24/self-hosting)

I run all of my self hosted services on a Raspberry Pi 3B and a HP EliteDesk G2 800 Mini. 

### [Audio](/projects/audio)

Pirate Audio released an awesome DAC HAT for the Pi that I use with a Raspberry Pi 2B to send high quality line out audio to my 70s/80s scavenged HiFi system.


## Software 

I use Visual Studio code with the Golang, C and Python language plugins. I prefer to write Java code in IntelliJ as I use it every day at work.
