---

Taking inspiration from [Zwischenzugs](https://zwischenzugs.com/2019/01/02/notes-on-books-read-in-2018/) and [Schen](https://shen.hong.io/reading/), I present my year in books.

- Queen of Spades by Pushkin 
- The Shepherd's Life by James Rebanks
- Ramble Book by Adam Buxton 
- Never Let Me Go by Kazuo Ishiguro 
- The Diamond Age by Neal Stephenson 
- The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain
