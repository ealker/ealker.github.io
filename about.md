Hi, I'm Elliot, a twenty-something software engineer based in London. I studied Computer Science at [Aberystwyth University](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/cs/) in Wales. I currently work with enterprise monitoring systems, middleware, infrastructure APIs and highly available cloud services at [JP Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/technology). I could be considered a [SRE engineer](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-sre). 

When I'm not at work I love to stay active by [paddleboarding](https://gallery.angharadbache.com/-paddleboardandchill/sneakpeek) and [hiking](https://gallery.angharadbache.com/-penyfan/gallery). I've attempted to play both  jazz and classical [violin](https://issuu.com/musicforyouth/docs/mfy_proms_programme_2016_rd8_ver2) and [piano](https://soundcloud.com/ealker) music. I'm interested in architecture, [politics](http://bronglais.blogspot.com/2017/05/aberystwyth-town-council-election.html) and the [open web]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link interests/openweb.md %}). I like to keep a log of most things I do, mainly because I have such a bad memory - this includes the films I watch, places I hike, and songs I rate.
