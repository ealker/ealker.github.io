This is my now page. 

[What's a now page?](https://nownownow.com/about)

It's a summary of what I'm working on in my life, and I'm what I'm planning to work on next. 

You can see other people's pages [here](https://nownownow.com/).

I'm currently learning the go programming language. I'm exploring London and travelling. I'm wanting to get back into
making music after a 6 year hiatus.
