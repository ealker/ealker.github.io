## Reactive Java

## Misc.

### Preferences 
[Oliver Drotbohm's article](https://odrotbohm.de/2013/11/why-field-injection-is-evil/) helped me decide the method of DI that I prefer for IoC. I was working in a code base that had both styles and the constructor injection was preferable. However I did use field injection when there were two conflicting Beans, solved with the following: 

```java
@Bean(name = "classname")
private someObject;
```
