### Smarthome

I've setup [a page](/projects/smarthome) to document my progress in setting up a self hosted smart-home. 

### Writing 

My [blog](/blog) contains a collection of my notes, articles, musings, rants, etc. and is an ongoing project. Why do I blog? [Steve Yegge](https://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs) has the answer.

### Other Interests

I like to track my media consumption; maybe you're interested in [the books I've read](/projects/bookshelf) and [the movies I've watched](/projects/movies)?

I'm also researching how to do more (or the same) with less...

- [Retro (Vintage) Computing](/projects/retro)
- [Eco/Collapse Computing](/projects/eco-computing)

I'm a fan of open standards!

- [The Small/Open/Indie Web](/projects/web)
