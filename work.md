I'm a backend engineer who's worked across teams and products in Payments and Engineering functions in a major investment bank. I've worked on observability tooling, developer portals, and customer identity and access management systems.

My current work is mainly in Golang, Java and JVM related technologies. I like learning new technology and over the past ten years I have used C for robotics work, Python for machine learning projects, Rego for CIAM work and JavaScript for front end projects. I've learnt and used a number of frameworks across those languages.  

I strive for simplicity and robustness in favour of complexity and over-engineering. I follow the Dieter Rams philosophy of *"Less, but better"*.
