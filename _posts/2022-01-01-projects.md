This year I thought I would try something different and publish a list of all the projects that I hope to complete. 

[] Finish my letterboxd script.  
[] Consolidate my machine learning knowledge.  
[] Deliver my python script that converts a folder into a photo gallery.  
[] Build on my university knowledge of [machine learning](http://www.sharetechnote.com).
