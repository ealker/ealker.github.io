I like plain text and simple HTML sites because they're fast, open, and will run on pretty much anything. Plain text is also [Lindy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect). 
You can view plain text and plain HTML sites on a Kindle. You can view them on vintage computers, especially easily with tools like [68k news](http://68k.news/) and [frog find](http://frogfind.com/) from [Action Retro](https://www.youtube.com/ActionRetro).

The [no css club](https://nocss.club/) is be too puritan for my tastes, but you might like it! I'm sure you've seen [motherfucking website](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/), but I think [this](https://thebestmotherfucking.website/) is far more usable.
