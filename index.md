Hi, I'm Elliot, a software engineer living and working in London. 

This site is my **[blog](/blog)** and [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). I've worked on a side few [projects](/projects) that might be of interest to you. You can see what I've been up to on my **[now](now)** page, see what I use on my **[uses](uses)** page, and view all this site's pages on the **[sitemap](sitemap)**. This site is a work in progress - I work on updating pages and posts when I have the time.

For my day job I write microservices and application backends in a range of architectural styles in Java and Go, and utilities and tools in Python and various scripting languages. This work ultimately helps to solve problems - [maybe I can help you](./about)?
