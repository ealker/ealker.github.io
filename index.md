Hello, I'm Elliot. I live and work in the UK. 

This site is my [blog](/blog), public [notebook](/notebook), and [portfolio](/projects). You can see what I've been up to on my [now](/now) page, see what I use on my [uses](/uses) page, and view all the permenant pages on the [sitemap](/sitemap). 

I treat this space as a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) - it's a work in progress, and I tend to the pages and posts when I have the time.

I write software for my day job. Please find more over on the [work](/work) page.
