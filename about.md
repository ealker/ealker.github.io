title: About Me
---

Hi, I'm Elliot, a Site Reliability/Software Engineer based in London.


#### Professional 

I studied Computer Science at [Aberystwyth University](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/cs/) in Wales, graduating in 2020 after four years (with a year in industry). 
I currently work with enterprise monitoring systems, message oriented middleware, infrastructure APIs and highly available cloud services at [JP Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/technology). Whilst my title is Software Engineer, due to the nature of my work I could be considered an [SRE engineer](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-sre).

I enjoy things that work, learning why they work and fixing things that don't work.

I have professional experience in Java, JavaScript, TypeScript and Go. I've shipped code using both  React and Spring frameworks. I've also used Kafka, Grafana, Docker, InfluxDB, Cassandra, Zookeeper in both personal and professional settings.  
    
#### Personal

Technically speaking, I'm interested in ecotechnology, computer vision, the open/indie web, and home automation.
        
I like to learn about architecture, politics, and the history of computing. 

When I'm not at work I stay active by [paddleboarding](https://gallery.angharadbache.com/-paddleboardandchill/sneakpeek) and [hiking](https://gallery.angharadbache.com/-penyfan/gallery).

I've attempted to play both jazz and classical [violin](https://issuu.com/musicforyouth/docs/mfy_proms_programme_2016_rd8_ver2) and [piano](https://soundcloud.com/ealker) music.

#### Talks

- [The Industrial Placement Year - a student's perspective](https://www.aber.ac.uk/~dcswww/Dept/Teaching/Year-2/Second_Year_Induction-2019.html) (2019): A short talk I gave at my university to encourage second year students to take a placement year in industry.
