I've been using my Retina MacBook Pro 2012 since early 2017. Like the rest of us, it's dying slowly. Sure, a dead pixel is fine. A creaking case? No problem. Sitting in the library trying to code whilst what sounds like a Boeing 747 landing next to you is a large enough problem to warrant the cold stare of a second year politics student as you ruin their study (procrastination) session. 

After reading Geoff Greer's [blog post](https://geoff.greer.fm/2017/01/23/oldest-viable-laptop/), I decided to bring my ThinkPad T420 out of retirement.
