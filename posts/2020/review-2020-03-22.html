        <h1>Weekly Review 22nd March 2020</h1>
        <p>There is so much content online with the potential to distract me that I often find it difficult to concentrate. When I'm focusing on a new idea,
        I often find that my focus is pulled away from it just as I get going. I might be thinking about a specific programming problem and suddenly think about some obscure 
        article I read three years ago. What was the name of the author? Is it in my bookmarks? No. Wait. It might be saved in a text file in my dropbox. Speaking of which, I really need 
        to sort out my entire photo library. Photos. Oh, Canon just released that new lens didn't they? ... Do you see my problem? Part of my solution to my attention defecit is to record
        in a blog post all of the interesting things that I've read, watched or listened. I have a theory that it'll free up room in my brain. Let's see if I'm right...

    <h2>I watched...</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkZj3Lbck5Q&list=LL5hq7oK0uo4zwfWrxDyRLhw&index=15">Clairo's interview with Matt Wilkinson</a> - I love the 90s "dream" feel to her music; another win for the YouTube recommendation algorithm.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p55cFT-ti-I&list=LL5hq7oK0uo4zwfWrxDyRLhw&index=22">A very short talk between Bill Gates and Prof. Vaclav Smil</a> - In addition to his philantropy, Bill Gates (and his team?) produces some great YouTube content. The <a href="https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80184771">Netflix documentary</a> on him is well worth a watch, if only to inspire you to read more.   
      </ul>
    
    <h2>I read...</h2>
    
    <h2>I listened to...</h2> 
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCsGWkRebw8">Stevie Ray Vaughn - Tin Pan Alley Live at Capitol Theatre</a></li>
      </ul> 
    
    <h2>Thoughts, rants, musings...</h2>
      There's been lots of underappreciated posts on HackerNews recently. I've been drawn to posts that are concerned with simplicity and openess, by this I mean posts
      that highlight unusual open source projects, software archival efforts and productivity with minimal tools.  
        
        I've found the following articles particularly interest: 
        
        <ul> 
            <li><a href="">Website Obesity Crisis</a></li>
        </ul>
