## What is the [small/open/indie web](https://indieweb.org/)? 

The small/open/indie web describes a section of the web that still values creativity, individuality and personalisation. It  shuns tracking, advertising and other types of privacy violations. It is the web as it was 25 years ago. Increasingly, it's also viewed as the web of tomorrow. The social web is dying, and the fediverse is taking its place.

### Types of small/open/indie websites

- Personal blogs 
- Open books 
- Digital gardens

### Components of a small/open/indie website
