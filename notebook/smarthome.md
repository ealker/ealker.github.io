### Matter & Thread 

[Thread](https://www.threadgroup.org/What-is-Thread/Thread-Benefits) is a smart home standard created by the [Connectivity Standards Alliance](https://csa-iot.org). It is based on the IEEE 802.15.4 Low Rate Personal Wireless Network (LR-PWN) standard, like Zigbee, which all of my IoT devices use.

Matter is an application layer that runs on the Thread protocol.
