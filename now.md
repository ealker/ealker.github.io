This is my now page. [What's a now page?](https://nownownow.com/about) It's a summary of what I'm working on in my life, and I'm what I'm planning to work on next. You can see other people's pages [here](https://nownownow.com/).

### Where am I? 

London, UK

### What am I doing? 

I'm working on payments technology at an investment bank. I've also worked on observability tools for SRE teams, message oriented middleware and Java libraries. My current work is focused on authentication, identity and security. 

### What are my interests? 

I'm reading a lot more than I used to. You can check out what I've read this year if you go to [my blog](/blog).

I've been exploring more of London, having moved hear just about a year ago. I've also been to Norway, Greece, Czechia and Wales.

I've picked up an interest in the financial markets, the payments tech industry and eco focused technology. I've also discovered a fascination with Georgian design, architecture and interiors.    

### What are my plans for the next year? 

I'm looking to get back to making music after a 6 year hiatus. I spent a huge amount of my free time doing this as a teenager, and it's something I miss doing.
