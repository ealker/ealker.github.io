title: An Overview of Web Development
--- 

I wrote my first line of HTML when I was about ten years old. Armed only with Windows Notepad, I created a simple web page that displayed a few lines of text. I then learnt that you could add images to the web page by inserting a different HTML tag, `<img>`, and refer to a image file in a local directory. I wanted to make my website look more "professional", so I learn that you could style these elements with a language called CSS. 
I learnt some more HTML, CSS and eventually some basic JavaScript. An acquaintance purchased a domain name and showed me how to use a WebDav folder on a remote Windows web web server to host my simple web pages.

Not long after, I remember reading a (paper) web dev magazine and learning about CMS systems, ASPX pages, and all sorts of other frameworks for building websites. The problem was I had no mental model for understanding how all of these technologies related to each other. It was only a few years later that I had a rough understanding of how various web frameworks hung togeher, and I now appreciate how their histories are related and how modern web apps are now built. This post serves two purposes, firstly to help the reader understand how different web dev approaches work, and second to clarify my own thoughts around various "web dev" concepts. 


## Static Pages

A single HTML page is the simplest web site. All you need is a single HMTL file - you can view it locally in your browser once it's been saved.  This is how most people learn to make websites. You can add CSS and JS with reference tags in the HTML header.

Alternatively, one could use a website maker program like FrontPage, Dreamweaver. WYSIWYG. These programs add CSS for you.

How do you host? 

Traditionally, you'd run a Web server application on some physical server you owned, or one that was colocated in a data centre. You'd configure your 

Cimpanies  then offered web hosting solutions, so you could simply get an FTP connection 

 virtual server (cloud), etc to display static page 

Known as static sites. 

Static site generators make this easier, just pick theme, write content, site is built and served up as a set of static pages

Alternative is CMS, which can be headless. Technology in every OO lanaguage which supports developments of CMSs. Wordpress is a popular one. Run it yourself on a server you own or get a company (like Automattik) to run an instance for you (known as SaaS) (read software for rent) 


## Dynamic Pages

<h3> Server Side Dynamic </h3>

Server side rendering - server creates pages and send HTML output over the wire. Page refreshes for new data and process starts all over again. 

JSP and ASPX dot net. 

Could talk Silver light and Flash.  

HTML 5 introduces new actions and can access device. No need for plugins installed on computers and mobiles to access flash and silver light type experiences. Steve jobs foresaw iPhone as having multiple web apps rather than device specific apps. There is a greater move to this although the experience is still somewhat confusing. Hybrid of React Native or Dart which devs write their apps once and then “run anywhere”, similar to the promise of BASIC or Java. Transpiles code from JS to device languages which call device libs. like Kotlin/Java for android or swif/Objective-C for iOS. 

Ruby on Rails and other frameworks. Write HTML templates, frameworks are opinionated and deal with data fetching from other APIs and data binding. Leads to


<h3>Client Side Dynamic</h3>

Single page applications 

Think react pages. Front end and back end of website decoupled. Front end in JS calls back end web service (REST applications) written in OO languages. Used to be Java, python rtc. Now most likely Node JS which allows JS code to execute outside of a browser context by essentially running a Javadcript engine on the desktop. Node now has its own frameworks which make routing, databinding, etc. easier (features which older SPA languages and opinionated frameworks had). 


Old Web technology 

- XLST 
- XML 
- Images Maps 


Consume restful web service in back end or front end - back end is like making a call to a local database - have to handle a response and deserialise into object.
