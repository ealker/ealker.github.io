### Software
A collection of software I've written. 

- [website](https://github.com/elliotalker/ealker.github.io): this website, built on the [Jekyll static site generator](https://jekyllrb.com) with a custom theme. 
- [bookmanager](https://github.com/elliotalker/bookmanager): an example Spring MVC based web app.
- [scripts](https://github.com/elliotalker/scripts): all of my scripts, in various languages.
- [dotfiles](https://github.com/elliotalker/dotfiles): all of my dotiles for macOS and various Linux distros. 
- web apps:

### Not Software

These didn't feel like they should be blog posts, rather living documents that I update every once in a while. 

##### Media Consumption

Outside of my weekly review posts, I like to track long term trends in my media consumption. 

- [Books I've Read](./projects/bookshelf.html)
- [Movies I've Watched](./projects/movies.html)

##### Smarthome

I also have an interest in smarthome technology. I've setup [a page](./projects/smarthome.html) to document my progress.
