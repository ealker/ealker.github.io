title:  "Notes on Golang"
---

Go is an incredibly concise and simple language that can border on the annoying when working with an overly large project; the brevity can cause confusion when context swtiching between Java and Go.

I enjoy working with JSON and other serialised data in Go as I don't have to create model classes with methods for deserialsition - it's all implicitly understood by the standard library when working with structs. This helps when writing REST web APIs.

Concurrency in Golang has been baked into the language.
