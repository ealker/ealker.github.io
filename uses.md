This is my [uses](https://uses.tech/) page.

It is my remix of Wes Bos' [/uses project](https://wesbos.com/uses), Paul Stamatiou's [gear page](https://paulstamatiou.com/stuff-i-use/) and the [Uses This](https://usesthis.com) interviews.

## Hardware 

### Workstation

I use a 2016 MacBook Pro and a Dell OptiPlex 3070. 

### Homelab 

I run all of my self hosted services on a Raspberry Pi 3B and a HP EliteDesk G2 800 Mini. 

### Audio 



## Software 

I use Visual Studio code with the Golang, C and Python language plugins. I prefer to write Java code in IntelliJ as I use it every day at work.
