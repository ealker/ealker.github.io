## ðŸ“º I watched 

- [Alistair Cambell's GQ interview with John McDonell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=joo4w_BwEJs): An interesting interview between (former?) political heavyweights with vastly different opinions.
- [James Scholz's YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/jamesscholz): I don't know how I found this guy but he's into a lot of the same stuff as me. I like his room setup, his to-the-camera pieces about his motivations for studying. He's a relaxing guy to listen to whilst working. Oh, he also has a [website](https://www.youtube.com/c/jamesscholz).
