Hi, I'm Elliot, a twenty-something software engineer based in London. I currently work with enterprise monitoring systems, middleware, infrastructure APIs and highly available cloud services. I could be considered a [SRE engineer](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-sre). 

When I'm not at work I love to stay active by paddleboarding and hiking. I'm interested in jazz and classical music, architecture, politics and the history of technology. I like to keep a log of most things I do, mainly because I have such a bad memory - this includes the films I watch, places I hike, and songs I rate.
