##### Hi, I'm Elliot, a Site Reliability/Software Engineer based in London.
<img src="./assets/img/elliot/elliot-small.jpg" width="200">

I [studied Computer Science](./university.html) at [Aberystwyth University](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/cs/) in Wales, graduating in 2020 after four years (with a year in industry). 

I currently work as an Associate Software Engineer at [JP Morgan](https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/technology) with enterprise monitoring systems and message oriented middleware. Whilst my title is Software Engineer, I could be considered an [SRE engineer](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-sre).

I have professional experience in Java, JavaScript (TypeScript), Python and Go. I've shipped code that uses React and Spring frameworks. I have working knowledge of Kafka, Grafana, Docker, InfluxDB, Cassandra, Zookeeper amonst other industry standard cloud native tools.  
    

#### Talks

- [The Industrial Placement Year - a student's perspective](https://www.aber.ac.uk/~dcswww/Dept/Teaching/Year-2/Second_Year_Induction-2019.html) (2019): A short talk I gave at my university to encourage second year students to take a placement year in industry.


#### Personal 

I like to learn about architecture, politics, and the history of computing. When I'm not at work I stay active by [paddleboarding](https://gallery.angharadbache.com/-paddleboardandchill/sneakpeek) and [hiking](https://gallery.angharadbache.com/-penyfan/gallery). I've attempted to play both jazz and classical [violin](https://issuu.com/musicforyouth/docs/mfy_proms_programme_2016_rd8_ver2) and [piano](https://soundcloud.com/ealker) music.
