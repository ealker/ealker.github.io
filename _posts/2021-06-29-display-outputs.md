title: "Display Outputs" 
---

My incredibly generous employer recently subsidized a new monitor purchase for my "WFH" setup.
I was unsure what specs to look for in a new monitor but I had a rough idea of my use case and the 
constraints. 
 
After reading Tonksy's post about 4K montiors, I decided to shop around for a 4K VA panel under 400USD.


Graphics specs on my Optiplex 3070 SFF: 

- Intel 630 Graphics (9th Gen I5-9500) 
- 1 Display Port 1.2 connector 
- 1 HDMI 1.4 connector
