This is my now page. [What's a now page?](https://nownownow.com/about) It's a summary of what I'm working on in my life, and I'm what I'm planning to work on next. You can see other people's pages [here](https://nownownow.com/).

### Where am I? 

London, UK

### What am I doing? 

I'm working on Payments technology at JP Morgan. Before returning to work with some of my former team in Payments, I spent two and a half years working on SRE monitoring tools for the bank. My current work is focused on authentication, identity and security, but I think that's about all I can say. 

### What are my interests? 

I'm reading a lot more than I used to. You can check out what I've read this year if you go to [my blog](/blog).

I've been exploring more of London, having moved hear just about a year ago. I've also been to Norway and Greece in the past year with a few visits to Wales interspersed between the two "big" trips.

I've picked up an interest in the financial markets, the payments tech industry and eco focused technology. I've also discovered a fascination with Georgain design, architecture and interiors.    

### What are my plans for the next year? 

I'm looking to get back to making music after a 6 year hiatus. I spent a huge amount of my free time doing this as a teenager, and it's something I miss doing.
