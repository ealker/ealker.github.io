title: What are you optimizing for? 
---

I was talking with my friend recently and I shared with them that I'm feeling quite bewildered about the future.
This isn't to say that I'm depressed, nor am I anxious, rather this feeling comes from the same place when one finishes a large project; I've been in what can only be described as a holding pattern whilst waiting for the previous chapter of my life to close, and now that it has, I'm unsure what I should do.

I did everything that I thought I was supposed to, and now that I've arrived I don't know where to go next. 

At the old Apple headquarters there's a quote by Steve Jobs in a hallway that reads

> If you do something and it turns out pretty good, then you should go do something else wonderful, not dwell on it for too long. Just figure out what's next.
