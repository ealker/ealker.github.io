title: 2022 Projects
---

This year I thought I would try something different and publish a list of all the projects that I hope to complete. 

- Reading List and Notes for 2022.  
- Python script that converts a folder into a photo gallery.  
- Build on my university knowledge of [machine learning](http://www.sharetechnote.com).
